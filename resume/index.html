          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <h3>CareerBuilder, Consumer Development Team</h3>
          <h4>Engineer Lead, July 2013 - present</h4>
          <h4>Software Engineer II, July 2012 - July 2013</h4>
          <h4>Software Engineer I, July 2011 - July 2012</h4>
          <p>
            I lead a small team of software engineers, working on the consumer-facing side of CareerBuilder. I started by leading development of everything on the mobile website, built originally in ASP.NET (C#). Since then, we have built the mobile website into a completely responsive Ruby on Rails site. My team and I now focus on delivering an insightful user experience to jobseekers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My day to day involves code reviews and mentoring, building new features on the site, and assisting in the planning and development of projects. I use Ruby on Rails with Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript. Working in a SOA, I have experience connecting with APIs to get much of my data. I have also worked on the APIs themselves, which were built in ASP.NET. Besides working with APIs for data, I have used several different SQL and NOSQL databases.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also participate as a host and mentor for a few of our internship programs. This includes a high school internship aimed at encouraging more girls to persue Computer Science (3 years), and CareerBuilder's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLpJa7WauGE">Bridge the Skills Gap</a> program (1 year).

          <h3>Platform Migration</h3>
          <p>
            I have been a key leader in the migration of the consumer-facing site from the legacy .Net platform to a new Ruby on Rails application. As part of this project, we have made drastic improvements to the user experience and development environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite parts of the new development environment include:
            <ul>
              <li>writing in Ruby, Haml, and Sass,</li>
              <li>testing with RSpec,</li>
              <li>on-demand deployments,</li>
              <li>and using the GitHub Flow for code reviews.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            My main contributions in this project were building the site mobile-first, developing a migration strategy, and then adding new features while progressively making the site responsive.
