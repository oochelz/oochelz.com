          <h4>Senior Software Engineer, August 2016 - June 2018</h4>
          <p>
            Working primarily with the Mobile Team, I began by writing API endpoints using PHP that would be used by our mobile applications. I quickly became a leader on the team, running projects as the Delivery Manager/Engineer Lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            In June 2018, I made the move to be an Engineering Manager. I now have 5 direct reports, all on different teams, who specialize in frontend and backend software engineering. I still lead a team in Mobile, improving the usability and growing the Mailchimp marketing platform.

          <p>
            After two years of being an individual contributor, I began leading development of the ASP.NET (C#) mobile website. In the latter three years, we built the mobile website into a responsive Ruby on Rails site. My team and I focused on delivering an insightful user experience to jobseekers.
          </p>
          <p>
            My day to day involved code reviews, mentoring, building new features on the site, and assisting in the planning of projects. I used Ruby on Rails with Haml, Sass, and CoffeeScript. Working in a SOA, I have experience connecting with APIs to get much of my data. I have also worked on the APIs themselves, which were built in ASP.NET.
          </p>
          <p>
            For three years, I served as a host and mentor for our CB Girls in Tech internship, aimed at encouraging more high school girls to pursue Computer Science. In 2016, I also hosted an intern from CareerBuilder's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLpJa7WauGE">Bridge the Skills Gap</a> program.

          <h3>Platform Migration, CareerBuilder</h3>
          <p>
            I was a key leader in the migration of the consumer-facing site from the legacy .NET platform to a new Ruby on Rails application. As part of this project, we made drastic improvements to the user experience and development environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite parts of the new development environment include:
            <ul>
              <li>writing in Ruby, Haml, and Sass,</li>
              <li>testing with RSpec,</li>
              <li>on-demand deployments,</li>
              <li>and using the GitHub Flow for code reviews.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            My main contributions in this project were building the site mobile-first, developing a migration strategy, and then adding new features while progressively making the site responsive.
