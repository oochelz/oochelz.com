          <p>July 2013 - present</p>
          <p>
            I lead a small team of engineers, working on the consumer-facing side of CareerBuilder. I started by leading development of everything on the mobile website. Since then, we have built the mobile website into a completely responsive Ruby on Rails site. My team and I now focus on delivering an insightful user experience to jobseekers.

          <p>
            Key leader in the migration of the consumer-facing site from the legacy .Net platform to a new Ruby on Rails application.
